Let G be a group.

Let M be a set.
Let G be a group.
Let f be a group action from G on M.
Let x << M.
Stab(x,f, M, G) = {y | y << El(G) and f[(y, x)] = x}.

Lemma.
Let M be a set.
Let G be a group.
Let f be a group action from G on M.
Let x << M.
Stab(x,f,M, G) is a subgroup of G.
Proof.

One(G) is an element of Stab(x, f, M, G).

Let us show that for all elements y, z of Stab(x, f, M, G)  z *^{G} Inv(y, G) << Stab(x, f, M, G).
  Let y, z be elements of Stab(x, f, M, G).
  We have f[(z *^{G} Inv(y, G), x)] = x.
  Therefore z *^{G} Inv(y, G) is an element of Stab(x, f, M, G).

Let M be a set.
Let G be a group.
Let f be a group action from G on M.

Let g, h be elements of El(G).
If Coset(g, Stab(x, f, M, G), G) = Coset(h, Stab(x, f, M, G), G) then f[(g, x)] = f[(h, x)].

##"Welldefined" by the previous Lemma.
Axiom.
Let M be a set.
Let G be a group.
Let f be a group action from G on M.
Let x << M.
There is a function h such that
h is from Cosets(Stab(x, f, M, G), G) to Orbit(x, f, M, G)

Lemma.
Let G be a finite group.
Let f be a group action from G on M.
Let x << M.
Orbit(x,f, M, G) is a finite set.
Proof.
  Define h[g] = f[(g, x)] for g in El(G).
  Dom(h) is a finite set.
  Orbit(x, f, M, G) is a subset of Range(h).
  Proof.
    Let us show that every element of Orbit(x, f, M, G) is an element of Range(h).
       (1) Let y be an element of Orbit(x, f, M, G).

       We can take an element g1 of El(G) such that y = f[(g1, x)] (by 1).

       Thus y is an element of Range(h).
    end.
  end.
  Therefore Orbit(x, f, M, G) is a finite set.
Qed.

Lemma.
Let M be a set.
Let G be a finite group.
Let f be a group action from G on M.
Let x << M.
Index(G, Stab(x, f, M, G)) = card(Orbit(x, f, M, G)).
Proof.

Take a function h such that
h is from Cosets(Stab(x, f, M, G), G) to Orbit(x, f, M, G)
and (for all elements i of El(G) h[Coset(i,Stab(x, f, M, G),G)] = f[(i, x)]).

h is surjective onto Orbit(x, f, M, G).
Proof.
  Let us show that for every element y of Orbit(x, f, M, G) there is an element z of Dom(f) such that f[z] = y.
    Let y be an element of Orbit(x, f, M, G).
    Take an element i of El(G) such that f[(i, x)] = y.
    Then we have h[Coset(i,Stab(x, f, M, G),G)] = y.
  end.
end.

h is injective.
Proof.
  Let us show that for all elements h1, h2 of Cosets(Stab(x, f, M, G), G) if h[h1] = h[h2] then h1 = h2.
    Let h1, h2 be elements of Cosets(Stab(x, f, M, G), G) such that h[h1] =h[h2].
    
    Take elements g1, g2 of El(G) such that h1 = Coset(g1,Stab(x, f, M, G),G) and h2 = Coset(g2, Stab(x, f, M, G),G).
  
    Then f[(g1, x)] = f[(g2, x)].
    f[((Inv(g2, G) *^{G} g1), x)] = f[((Inv(g2, G)*^{G} g2), x)] = x.
    
    Thus Inv(g2, G) *^{G} g1 is an element of Stab(x, f, M, G).
    Therefore h1 = h2.
  end.
