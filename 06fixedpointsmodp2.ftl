  Take an element y of M such that x is an element of Orbit(y, f, G, M) and y is not an element of fixedPoints(M, G, f).
  x is an element of M.
  x is not an element of fixedPoints(M, G, f).

Let us show that every element of M \\ fixedPoints(M, G, f) is an element of Union(OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M)).
  Let x be an element of M \\ fixedPoints(M , G, f).

Qed.

Signature.
Let p be a prime number.
A group of order p is a finite group H such that
(there is a natural number n such that card(El(H)) = p ^ n).

Axiom cardUnion3.
Let M be a set.
Let k be an integer.
If M is a finite set such that every element of M is a finite set
and M is disjunct collection
and for all elements N of M k | card(N)
then k |Â card(Union(M)).

Lemma.
Let M be a finite set.
Let p be a prime number.
Let G be a group of order p.
Let f be a groupaction from G on M.
card(fixedPoints(M, G, f)) = card(M) (mod p).
Proof.

Union(OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M)) is a subset of M.

Let us show that p | card(Union(OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M))).
  [prove off]
  OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) is a finite set.
  [/prove]

  Every element of OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) is a finite set.

  p is an integer.

  Let us show that for all elements N1 of OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) p | card(N1).
    Let N be an element of OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M).

    Take an element x of M such that N = Orbit(x, f, G, M).
    
    Let us show that card(N) != 1.
      Assume the contrary.
       
      x is not a fixedPoint on M on G of f.

      x is an element of N.
      Thus x is a fixedPoint on M on G of f.

      Contradiction.
    end.

    We have card(N) = Index(G, Stab(x, f, G, M)).
    Hence card(El(G)) = card(Stab(x, f, G, M))*card(N) and card(N) | card(El(G)).
    Therefore p | card(N).
  end.

  (1) OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) is a finite set such that every element of OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) is a finite set.
  (3) OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) is a disjunct collection and for all elements N of OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M) p | card(N).

  Therefore  p | card(Union(OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M))) (by cardUnion3, 1, 3).
end.
 
We have card(M) = card(fixedPoints(M, G, f)) + card(Union(OrbitsNotTriv(f, G, M))).

Therefore  card(M) = card(fixedPoints(M, G, f)) (mod p).
