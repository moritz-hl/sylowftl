Let M, N denote sets.
Let x << M stand for x is an element of M.

Definition.
Prod(M,N) = { (x,y) | x << M and y << N }.

Definition.
A subset of M is a set N such that every element of N is an element of M.

Definition.
Let M be a set.
M is empty iff there is no element x of M such that x = x.

Definition.
Let M be a set such that for all elements N of M N is a set.
\-/ M = {x | There is an element N of M such that x is an element of N}.

Definition.
Let N1, N2 be sets.
N1 \-/ N2 = {x | x is an element of N1 or x is  an element of N2}.

Definition.
Let N1 be a set.
Let N2 be a subset of N1.
N1 \\ N2 = {x | x is an element of N1 and (x is not an element of N2)}.

Definition.
Let N1, N2 be a sets.
N1 and N2 are disjunct iff there is no element x of N1 such that x is an element of N2.

Definition.
A disjunct collection is a set M such that 
(for all elements N of M N is a set) and for all elements N1, N2 of M (N1 = N2 or ( N1 and N2 are disjunct)).

Definition.
Let f be a function. Let M,N be sets. f is from M to N iff Dom(f) = M and for every element x of M f[x] is an element of N.

Definition.
Let f be a function. Range(f) = {f[x] | x << Dom(f)}.

Definition.
Let f be a function. f is injective iff for all elements x,y of Dom(f) we have (x!=y => f[x] != f[y]).

Definition.
Let f be a function. f is surjective onto M iff (f is from Dom(f) to M and for every y << M there is an element x of Dom(f) such that f[x]=y).
